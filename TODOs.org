* Current 

** TODO side-by-side events

If we have overlapping events, they should automatically subdivide

** TODO Open from caldav

New events -> PUT request

** TODO yank
** TODO paste
** TODO undo stack
** TODO Movement should scroll the screen
** TODO Figure out keys for event-movement

Right now it's j/k but that should probably be reserved for
moving around in general.

Options:

- n/p ?
** TODO Test writing cal to disk
** TODO adjust time block size


* CALDAV

** TODO Open calendar from caldav 
** TODO Calendar color 
** TODO PUT requests when adding new events
- event log for this would be a bonus

* Keys

** TODO O       open_up
** TODO i       create_event
** TODO J       join two events?
** TODO dd      delete event, pushing lower events up to fill the hole
** TODO x,D?    delete event

* UI

** TODO remember scroll and zoom position?

** TODO minimum event height for instantaneous events
Right now they have a height of 0
